# Media-and-Graphic-Design
When I was 13, I taught myself how to torrent Photoshop. I couldn't afford it but needed a a tool to convey the creative thoughts in my head, so I taught myself graphic design.

When I was 15, I learned that media is little without distribution, so I studied Facebook's Reach algorithm, growth-hacking, and got to work. I managed multiple Facebook pages and groups, learning the ins and outs of the minds of consumers.
